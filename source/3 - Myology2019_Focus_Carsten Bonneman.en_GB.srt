1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,860
We are working on congenital muscular dystrophies,

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,820
which are genetic disorders of muscles

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,320
that are present at birth.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,770
We are particularly working on a  type called

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,620
collagen VI-related congenital muscular dystrophy,

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,820
which are severe types, also known as

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,580
Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,460
This is caused by mutations in the collagen VI genes.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,120
There are 3 collagen VI genes and mutations

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,260
in the collagen VI genes can cause this disease.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,220
We are trying to understand how the mutations

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,740
cause the disease and what you can do about it.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,800
So for the collagen VI genes, it is interesting that

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,500
mutations are often acting as a dominant,

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,240
meaning they are causing a toxic product from

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,350
the mutant gene that interferes with the normal collagen VI.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,620
We are devising fair pieces, trying to detoxify

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,600
the muscle from this product, the mutant product.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,780
We are trying to "knock down" the mutation readout

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,460
from the mutant genes using oligo-nuclear type saRNA,

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,580
and all of the CRISPR cross approaches.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,660
That is particularly relevant for a new and common mutation,

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,100
that we found in collagen VI,

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,860
which is a deep intronic mutation,

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,860
a mutation that has been hidden from our analysis so far,

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,260
and that causes a pseudo-exon and a toxic pseudo-exon,

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,440
to be spliced into the collagen VI gene.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,540
We are trying to skip that out using oligo-nuclear type therapies.

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,700
This is a highly individualised therapy,

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,380
so we have to devise a therapy for each individual mutation

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,520
that we find in the collagen VI genes.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,860
This is really a prime example of precision medicine,

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,700
or tailor-made medicine for a particular mutation

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,490
for a particular patient.

35
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,860
So that is the goal, in our laboratories,

36
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,630
to be precise about the diagnosis leading

37
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,980
to precise therapies for individual patients.

38
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,780
Organisations like the AFM will play a big role

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,340
in making possible that therapies become available

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,740
for even mutations that are very rare,

41
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,620
and for patients that are not large in number,

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,100
and so that is a project that by necessity

43
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,070
has to be funded by public funds,

44
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,580
by patient advocacy

45
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
and the AFM will play a big role in

46
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,500
making possible that the research

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,460
can really go down

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,140
to the level of the individual patients.
