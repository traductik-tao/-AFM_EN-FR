1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,820
We have been studying myostatin inhibition

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,150
for a variety of muscle disorders, which include

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,780
Duchenne, Becker's,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,500
facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophies,

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,540
limb-girdle muscular dystrophies,

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,780
and sporadic IBM.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,500
So myostatin is a natural inhibitor

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,980
of muscle growth.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,620
It circulates in the body

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,020
and keeps muscle growth in check.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,420
When you inhibit myostatin,

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,500
you get increased muscle growth, increased strength,

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,540
and an improvement in muscle quality,

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,740
that is less fibrosis or scarring of tissue.

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,540
And so this has been really, very promising

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,060
in animal models, and now has been translated

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,940
into human clinical trials.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,780
There has been several different types

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,060
of myostatin inhibitors being trialled

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,540
in muscular dystrophies and myopathies.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,780
The AFM has been incredibly helpful

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,860
in organizing and motivating, and

23
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,620
propelling research forward

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,220
in the neuromuscular disorders.

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,300
The meeting today...

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,300
has really been very successful.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,380
The AFM has organized and funded,

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,780
bringing together researchers from around the world

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,260
to discuss the latest in myopathies.

30
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,940
The AFM also funds

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,780
a significant amount of research

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,180
and is really at the forefront

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,380
of bringing these novel therapies to patients.
