1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,900
I'm working on a rather rare muscle disease

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,700
called GNE myopathy.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,740
In the past, it was called also

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,300
hereditary inclusion body myopathy,

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,580
or distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,340
It's an adult-onset myopathy

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,660
beginning in the distal muscles of the legs,

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,620
and slowly progressing to affect

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,780
the upper limbs too.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,740
Usually the onset is in the early adulthood,

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,980
and the disease progresses slowly

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,660
over several decades,

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,140
leading to a marked disability over the years.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,020
We recently had a phase-3 trial.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,180
In fact this is the first phase-3 trial

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,060
in distal myopathy

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,900
that was conducted, and unfortunately,

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,340
it did not show any improvement

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,140
with supplementation of sialic acid,

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,140
which was thought to be

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,380
the cause of the disease — i.e. the deficiency,

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,100
The difficulty in that study was that

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,860
this was a short study compared

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,780
to the disease progression,

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,220
and that people were very variable

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,780
in the severity of their disorders:

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Some of them were more rapidly progressing

28
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,580
as compared to others, and because of that,

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,620
the supplementation did not show

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,340
a positive effect in this trial.

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,020
The message is that despite the fact

32
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,740
that this trial has helped,

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,740
we have not stopped trying.

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,100
First of all, we have learned a few things

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,260
from the supplementation with sialic acid,

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,220
and a rather similar metabolic approach

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,700
is now underway in the United States,

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,780
learning from previous problems

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
that we had in the study,

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,020
including outcome measures,

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,060
how to follow patients and for how long...

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,940
We had in fact a joint meeting, a workshop,

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,300
with all leaders in this field,

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,370
to try and find a common way of collaboration,

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,540
because this is a rare disease,

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,880
but it is clustered in some ethnic populations,

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,980
which need to be approached.

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,700
Some of those are not privileged people,

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,500
and because of that, it is hard to conduct

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,140
a study in such a population.

51
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,320
However, the disease is a worldwide disease,

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,230
and there are probably a couple of dozens

53
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,140
of patients here in France too.
