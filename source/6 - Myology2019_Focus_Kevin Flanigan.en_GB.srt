1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,500
My lab works mostly on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Today at the conference, I spoke about

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,900
two different approaches

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,100
to treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy,

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,740
two different gene-therapy based approaches.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,940
The first of these is called surrogate gene therapy.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,580
In surrogate gene therapy we don't try to replace

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,060
the missing gene, the missing dystrophin protein.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,580
We instead use a substitute gene,

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,820
one that can substitute in function for it.

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,980
And the gene we use is called GALGT2.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,060
GALGT2 is a protein that is normally expressed

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,940
at the dystroglycan complex.

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,620
It was called the neuromuscular junction,

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,340
where nerve meets muscle.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,900
And in that place, dystrophin protein

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,140
does not bind to the complex.

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,780
Instead, a different protein called utrophin does.

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,740
That is where GALGT2 is usually found.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,180
So it turns out that we overexpress,

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,100
if we deliver GalGT2,

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,820
the muscle will make the same complex

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,260
occur across the entire muscle memory,

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,980
sort of make utrophin substitute for dystrophin.

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,100
It actually makes other proteins

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,580
that are important for stabilising the muscles.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,780
It turned out as well.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,060
So that is the surrogate gene approach,

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,180
and tomorrow we will be doing it in clinical trials in patients, the substitute.

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,740
The second thing I talked about

31
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,580
was a way of combining exon skipping

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,100
and gene therapy.

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,460
So in this case we use a virus,

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,340
the AAV virus.

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,300
We use that virus to deliver

36
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,900
a form of RNA

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,140
that never gets turned into a new protein.

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,820
But that RNA that we deliver,

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,500
called the U7 small nuclear RNA

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,620
can interfere with splicing.

41
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,060
It interferes with splicing very efficiently.

42
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,100
So in that case, we are directing our splicing RNA,

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,180
we just direct it to exon 2

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,340
and we have learned that we can highly efficiently

45
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,580
skip a duplicated copy of exon 2.

46
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,180
As a result, we can make

47
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,300
a perfectly normal dystrophin...

48
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
or if we skip too much,

49
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,140
we make a kind of dystrophin

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,300
that is really very protective.

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,420
That allows for example people

52
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,100
who walk around making that type of dystrophin...

53
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,220
They walk into their seventh decade

54
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,340
or their eighth decade.

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,980
So it is really very functional.

56
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,380
We call it "virally-mediated exon skipping".

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,780
It is something first developed here in France,

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,940
with funding from the AFM long ago,

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,540
and we now applied it to exon 2

60
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,260
for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

61
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,740
The AFM is a terrific organisation

62
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,860
that has a world-wide impact

63
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,580
in the study and treatment of neuro-muscular diseases

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,180
and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in particular.

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,180
I first learned of the AFM years ago

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,460
when I was first in laboratory

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,060
working with the agency that developed the Genethon.

68
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,620
Since then I had a terrific, long interaction

69
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,180
with the AFM,

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,700
and the AFM helped to fund a sabbatical year

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,540
that I did here in Paris at the institute of Myology,

72
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,740
which really is one of the world's leading institutions for

73
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,500
the coordinated care in research in the muscle diseases.

74
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,820
And I continue to have close interactions

75
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,420
with Genethon and the Institute of Myology

76
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,660
and other researches from the AFM.

77
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,540
I look forward to cementing,

78
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,220
to building on this relationship

79
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,940
in the coming years as well.
